  <header><h1>About ScienceEcosystem</h1></header>

  <section>
    <h2>Why We’re Building This</h2>
    <p>
      Science today is slowed down by a broken system, paywalled publications, scattered tools, and outdated incentives. 
      Researchers spend too much time managing logistics instead of doing research.
    </p>
    <p>
      ScienceEcosystem is our response. It's not just a platform, but a new foundation for how science can work: open, efficient, and collaborative from start to finish.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What We Believe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Openness</strong> — Research should be free to access, share, and reuse.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity</strong> — Trust grows when methods, data, and review are transparent.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> — Science improves when researchers can work together across fields and borders.</li>
      <li><strong>Equity</strong> — Tools and knowledge should be available to everyone, not just elite institutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
<section>
  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>ScienceEcosystem is built for the long term. Over the next years, we aim to transform how science is created, shared, and used. We will be replacing journals and paywalls with a unified, open infrastructure that serves the entire research community and the public.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No more journals:</strong> Research is shared as modular, living knowledge—open for review, reuse, and refinement from day one.</li>
    <li><strong>All scientific knowledge is open:</strong> Data, code, methods, commentary, funding, and review are fully accessible and connected.</li>
    <li><strong>AI works in the background:</strong> Smart tools summarize, link, and verify work quietly, without interrupting researchers or taking credit.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration over competition:</strong> Scientists, institutions, and even private partners contribute to a shared public commons.</li>
    <li><strong>The paper is replaced:</strong> Research is validated through transparency and reproducibility, not journal brands or gatekeeping.</li>
    <li><strong>Science becomes public infrastructure:</strong> ScienceEcosystem is as essential and trusted as Wikipedia, nonprofit, and built to last.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We believe scientific knowledge is too important to be hidden, sold, or lost. ScienceEcosystem will always be free, nonprofit, and owned by the communities it serves.</p>
</section>

  <section>
    <h2>Who It’s For</h2>
    <p>
      ScienceEcosystem is built for researchers, students, educators, and funders, anyone who believes science should work better than it does today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re publishing a dataset, reviewing a preprint, or coordinating an interdisciplinary project, our aim is to support the full lifecycle of scientific work, not just the final publication.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Where We're Going</h2>
    <p>
      We’re starting small, testing ideas with early adopters, and staying grounded in real research needs. 
      As we grow, our goal is to become a shared infrastructure, not a product to sell, but a system to build with the scientific community.
    </p>

    <h2>How We’re Building ScienceEcosystem</h2>
    <p>
      ScienceEcosystem is designed to grow in stages, starting with essential tools that address the most urgent barriers in science today, 
      and expanding into a full open research infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are focused on steady, thoughtful development, working closely with early users and institutions to guide each step.
    </p>
    <p>We envision that in the future, science is no longer captured in static papers, but in dynamic, modular research objects that evolve over time.</p>
