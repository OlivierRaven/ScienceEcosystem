    <h2>Why We’re Building This</h2>
    <p>
      Science today is slowed down by a broken system, paywalled publications, scattered tools, and outdated incentives. 
      Researchers spend too much time managing logistics instead of doing research.
    </p>
    <p>
      ScienceEcosystem is our response. It's not just a platform, but a new foundation for how science can work: open, efficient, and collaborative from start to finish.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Believe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Openness</strong> — Research should be free to access, share, and reuse.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity</strong> — Trust grows when methods, data, and review are transparent.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> — Science improves when researchers can work together across fields and borders.</li>
      <li><strong>Equity</strong> — Tools and knowledge should be available to everyone, not just elite institutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Who It’s For</h2>
    <p>
      ScienceEcosystem is built for researchers, students, educators, and funders, anyone who believes science should work better than it does today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re publishing a dataset, reviewing a preprint, or coordinating an interdisciplinary project, our aim is to support the full lifecycle of scientific work, not just the final publication.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Where We're Going</h2>
    <p>
      We’re starting small, testing ideas with early adopters, and staying grounded in real research needs. 
      As we grow, our goal is to become a shared infrastructure, not a product to sell, but a system to build with the community.
