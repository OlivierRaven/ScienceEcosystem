      <h2>Why We’re Building This</h2>
      <p>
        Science today is slowed down by a broken system — paywalled publications, scattered tools, and outdated incentives.
        Researchers spend too much time managing logistics instead of doing research.
      </p>
      <p>
        ScienceEcosystem is our response. It’s not just a platform, but a new foundation for how science can work: open, efficient,
        and collaborative from start to finish.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Openness</strong> — Research should be free to access, share, and reuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> — Trust grows when methods, data, and review are transparent.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> — Science improves when researchers work together across fields and borders.</li>
        <li><strong>Equity</strong> — Tools and knowledge should be available to everyone, not just elite institutions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>ScienceEcosystem is built for the long term. Over the next years, we aim to transform how science is created, shared, and used. We will replace journals and paywalls with a unified, open infrastructure that serves the entire research community and the public.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No more journals:</strong> Research is shared as modular, living knowledge—open for review, reuse, and refinement from day one.</li>
        <li><strong>All scientific knowledge is open:</strong> Data, code, methods, commentary, funding, and review are fully accessible and connected.</li>
        <li><strong>AI works in the background:</strong> Smart tools summarize, link, and verify work quietly, without interrupting researchers or taking credit.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration over competition:</strong> Scientists, institutions, and private partners contribute to a shared public commons.</li>
        <li><strong>The paper is replaced:</strong> Research is validated through transparency and reproducibility, not journal brands or gatekeeping.</li>
        <li><strong>Science becomes public infrastructure:</strong> As essential and trusted as Wikipedia, nonprofit, and built to last.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We believe scientific knowledge is too important to be hidden, sold, or lost. ScienceEcosystem will always be free, nonprofit, and owned by the communities it serves.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Who It’s For</h2>
      <p>Researchers, students, educators, funders — anyone who believes science should work better than it does today.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re publishing a dataset, reviewing a preprint, or coordinating an interdisciplinary project, our aim is to support the full lifecycle of scientific work, not just the final publication.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Where We're Going</h2>
      <p>We’re starting small, testing ideas with early adopters, and staying grounded in real research needs. As we grow, our goal is to become a shared infrastructure — not a product to sell, but a system to build with the scientific community.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Shape the Future of Open Science</h2>
      <p>ScienceEcosystem is just beginning. We’re looking for people who want to help build something better — from the ground up. Whether you’re a researcher, developer, funder, or open science advocate, there’s a role here for you.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="panel">
      <h2>Ways to Contribute</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Researchers</strong> — Help test early features and tell us what tools you actually need.</li>
        <li><strong>Developers</strong> — Join our open‑source work and help build modular, transparent infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Funders</strong> — Support an initiative focused on openness, equity, and long‑term public value.</li>
        <li><strong>Advisors</strong> — Contribute insight from science, policy, or community organizing to guide our growth.</li>
